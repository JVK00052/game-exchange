## Nail'd It
Is a sudo storefront project that was designed to simulate a customer's shopping experience for hardware store items. By signing up and becoming a member the user has the ability to shop and add items to their cart as they please. When finished shopping the user can purchase these items and their cart will be cleared of all items that were bought.This web application was built using JavaScript, Angular 7, Node.js, Html 5 and Css 3.
